/****STEPS****/
/*************/

0 - Clone or download a .zip of this repository from :https://github.com/muhammadbsalman/CadmiumRockPaperScissorsSimulation

1 - A brief overview of this simulation and model can be found in RPS_Overview_Form.doc

2 - To compile all tests and simulations, follow the steps below
	1 - Start a new Linux terminal (Ubuntu) or Cygwin terminal (Windows) at ../CadmiumRockPaperScissorsSimulation-main
	2 - Running the commands below will clean all script, bin, and build files, and then remake the bin and build files
			make clean; make all
			
3 - All executables should now be in /bin. To run each test, navigate to /bin, and execute as such./EXE_NAME.EXE or ./EXE_NAME

4 - The simulation results for the executed files will be located in /simulation_results, including state/output logs
	
5 - Note: RPS_SIMULATION.EXE is the main simulation, the rest are self-explanatory by their names, and only represent a specific model

6 - To change any of the tests, and to alter the input data, simply change the associated file in /input_data
